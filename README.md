# Day 6 – NumPy Basics 🧮

This Jupyter Notebook is part of my daily learning challenge where I explore and document core concepts in data science and Python. On Day 6, I focused on mastering **NumPy**, one of the foundational libraries for numerical computing in Python.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- Introduction to NumPy
- Creating arrays using `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`
- Array indexing and slicing
- Array shape manipulation
- Element-wise operations
- Broadcasting
- Common NumPy functions like `np.mean`, `np.sum`, `np.max`, `np.min`, etc.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- The power of NumPy in performing efficient mathematical operations
- How NumPy arrays differ from Python lists
- The importance of broadcasting and how it helps in performing operations across arrays of different shapes

## 📂 File

- `Day6_numpy_basic.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with detailed code and explanations
